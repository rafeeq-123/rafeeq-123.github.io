Why did it take me so long to come back to do a Rails project. Do you want the short answer or the long one? 
Short answer: I thought it wasn't needed, I already started looking for Support Engineer jobs and that is a fulltime job.

Well then whats the longish you ask? I love Ruby and I love Rails very much. I have learned so much with just playing around with Rails. Exploring Rails, there is some much one can out of the box it is pretty amazing. MVC frameworks helps one to really create beautitful code. How many junior engineers really use something like Helpers? I love keeping even the slightest logic out of my Views. My point is there is a lot. Well...okay, but what does this actually have to do with why it took me so long to just turn my project in? Abosultly nothing at all. I love Rails. 

The long answer is that I life got in the way and I never stopped programming. I have ran into so pretty cool problem that left me pretty stumpped for like a week. I wanted to track users involvement for the cause and reward them for being involved. My idea is users have an enrollement fee and that they get "money" back to give to whatever back and I stupdely tried to make an exception in my Controller and that gave me a unqiue bug that timed the 5 they were given as "money" by 10 and that amount every time. I tried making code for the edge case after edge case and that was pretty on Rails Controller like. I ended up putting the code in my Model as a Vaildation. Coding as challednged me in ways school never really did. 

Code has giving me a new chance at a new life that I have not been able to achieve yet. I got to express myself that I never really could in writing that I feel I can in code, its art what some people can do (not at this level yet).
